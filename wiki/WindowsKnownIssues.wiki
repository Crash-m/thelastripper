TheLastRipper depends on Last.fm protocol 1.1, which have been dropped. I'm sorry to say that this breaks all current versions of TheLastRipper. More information:

*delay between metadata and music* Sometimes the songs are getting cut too soon or too late, see this bug report for a more technical description of the issue:
   * http://code.google.com/p/thelastripper/issues/detail?id=6
*Skip function* it's known that the skip function doesn't always work, but it shouldn't take down the application anymore. All other bugs should be fixed.

===TheLastRipper Version 1.0.0===
*Dual Core Support* TheLastRipper developer team has experienced problems with running TheLastRipper under windows with a Dual Core PC, this may only be a unique incident. If you have a Dual Core PC running windows and TheLastRipper, we would like to hear from you.

*Skip function* The skip function in the windows version is not working properly, but we are working on a bugfix.

*Remember Password function* The windows version of TheLastRipper can not remember the password for your Last.fm account. But we are currently working on a bugfix.
