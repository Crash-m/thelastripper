The first box that will be shown, is the box above. It shows the login menu, before you get started you need to have a Last.fm account, which is available at https://www.last.fm/join/ . If you already have an account you are ready to proceed. Next you gotta type in your accountname and password in the textboxes. When you have this all settled, you push the login button and you are ready to begin recording, you only need to push the close button in the lower right corner. But we suggest that you follow the next few steps before you begin recording.

Before you get the box shown above, you gotta select it from the tabs, in the top of the program window. When you have it opened, you will see a path selector like you know from a lot of other places in ubuntu. The default path is set to ~/Music. But in this menu, you can change this by selecting another folder to save in.

= Setting playlist information =

To enter this box, you will have to push the "Playlist settings" tab in the top of the window. When you enter the box you will be given a list of checkboxes to choose between. The first you will have to choose is where the playlist will be generated from, loved tracks, top tracks or just random. You also have to choose the format of the playlist, if it is a .m3u, .pls or a .smil. When you have been through these simple steps, you are ready to start recording and the only thing left is to push the close button in the lower right corner.
