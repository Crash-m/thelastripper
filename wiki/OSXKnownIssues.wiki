==All versions broken ==
TheLastRipper depends on Last.fm protocol 1.1, which have been dropped. I'm sorry to say that this breaks all current versions of TheLastRipper. More information:

== TheLastRipper Version 0.2.1 ==
*delay between metadata and music* Sometimes the songs are getting cut too soon or too late, see this bug report for a more technical description of the issue:

*Typo* there's a typo in the app bundle that prevents the application from launching.
