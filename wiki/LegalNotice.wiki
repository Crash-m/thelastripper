= Danish Law =

The danish law is very unclear on this subject and therefore this is our interpretation of the copyright law. This means that this does not have to be completly correct and is only consultive.
In denmark the law says that it is legal to rip music from the radio, but it needs to be for your own use only, you are not allowed to copy the music you rip or to give it to any of your friends. Only your household are allowed to use this music.
