The picture above, shows the main window when you are recording with TheLastRipper. It features a field where you can choose which station you want to record from. You can either choose to use one of the stations already specified in the box, or you can go to: http://www.last.fm/listen/ to creata a playlist with one of your favourite artist. When you have specified the channel you are ready to press the "Tune in" button and TheLastRipper will start to record. When the program is recording you can skip, hate or love songs like you do in the Last.fm radio. You can also choose a new station and begin recording from this. Beneath this field, you can see another field where all the info about the song is shown, including album pictures. Also there is included a statusbar so you can follow the progress.
