= Logging in =

The first box that will be shown when you start the program, is the box above. It shows the login menu and some other settings but first we will show you how to login, before you get started you need to have a Last.fm account, which is available at http://www.last.fm/join/ . If you already have an account you are ready to proceed. Next you gotta type in your accountname and password in the textboxes. When you have this all settled, you push the login button and you are ready to begin recording. But we suggest that you follow the next few steps before you begin recording.

= Setting the save path =

The default save path is set to your personal "Music" directory but you can easily change this by choosing another path. You can either do this by typing in the path or pres the "Browse" button, to se the directories.
