The first box you will we be shown, is the box shown above here. It features a login field with a box to write your Last.fm username, which is available at: https://www.last.fm/join/ . And it also features a box to write your password in. When you have obtained your Last.fm login and typed it in the boxes, you are ready to proceed, by pressing the loginbutton. When this is done you are ready to step down into the next field, where you can choose where the music will be saved. After this we proceed to the next field, where the playlist generator is located, to the left you can choose where the playlist will be generated from and to the right you can choose which format the playlist will be generated into, we have limited the number of formats to three (.pls, .smil and .m3u).
