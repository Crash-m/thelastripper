At first the recorder is not tuned in to any station, so before you press the "Tune in" button you need to choose a station to record from. If you press the arrow facing downwards to the right of the textbox, you will be shown the 10 most played globaltags. But you can also copy and paste in URL's to your own stations. All you need to know is the Last.fm URL.

When you are recording, there are some small functions you can use. For example there are functions, like you know from your normal Last.fm player. You can skip, love or ban the song you are hearing. And besides that, you can also choose another station and tune into it, at any time you want to. Information about the progress of the song and about the song, is also displayed, so you can always see which song you are recording at the time.
