# Logging in #

The first box that will be shown when you start the program, is the box above. It shows the login menu and some other settings but first we will show you how to login, before you get started you need to have a Last.fm account, which is available at http://www.last.fm/join/ . If you already have an account you are ready to proceed. Next you gotta type in your accountname and password in the textboxes. When you have this all settled, you push the login button and you are ready to begin recording. But we suggest that you follow the next few steps before you begin recording.

# Setting the save path #

The default save path is set to your personal "Music" directory but you can easily change this by choosing another path. You can either do this by typing in the path or pres the "Browse" button, to se the directories.

# Playlist settings #

In the lower part of the box you will se the playlist settings. In the box there are a given a list of checkboxes to choose between. The first you will have to choose, is where the playlist will be generated from; loved tracks, top tracks or just random. You also have to choose the format of the playlist, if want a .m3u, .pls or a .smil. When you have been through these simple steps, you are ready to start recording and the only thing left is to push the OK button in the lower left corner.
